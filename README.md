# VMFARMS

Title: VMFARMS-Hello
---------------------

This is a simple API that takes optional argument name and returns Hello <name>. if no argument is provided, it returns Hello stranger!.
  
Getting Started
---------------
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 

Prerequisites
-------------
* Django 2.1.3 (this is the version I used, but I do believe it will work with django 2.0)
* Python 3.7 (this is the version I used, but I do believe it will work with python 3.*)

IDE
----
Visual Studio Code (any good IDE will do - like pycharm)

Installing (Windows 10)
-----------
1. Install python from the website https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ***After you install it, make sure to add it to your Environment Variable
   ***If you use linux, make sure to create a virtual environment 
2. At this point, you should be able to install Django using 'pip install django'. 
   
   if you cannot, then you should install pip first.
   to install pip:
   * Linux:
      curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
      python get-pip.py 
   * Windows
      Download the get-pip.py
      open a terminal and run python get-pip.py
   Now you can run the command 'pip install django'
 
3. At this point you should have python and django properly installed.
4. git clone the repository I sent to you (https://github.com/HiAragorn/VMFARMS.git)
   Open your IDE (visual studio code), and open a folder and select VMFARMS as folder to open.
   or you can just drag and drop the folder into your IDE
5. From a terminal, CD into VMFARMS folder and run 'python manage.py runserver'
   a local server should start. 
   
   now go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and test.
